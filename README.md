# notifications-admin

GOV.UK Notify admin application.


## Features of this application

 - Register and manage users
 - Create and manage services
 - Send batch emails and SMS by uploading a CSV
 - Show history of notifications

## First-time setup

Brew is a package manager for OSX. The following command installs brew:
```shell
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Languages needed
- Python 3.4
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) 5.0.0 or greater
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 3.0.0 or greater
```shell
    brew install node
```


[NPM](npmjs.org) is Node's package management tool. `n` is a tool for managing
different versions of Node. The following installs `n` and uses the latest
version of Node.
```shell
    npm install -g n
    n latest
    npm rebuild node-sass
```

The app runs within a virtual environment. We use mkvirtualenv for easier working with venvs
```shell
    pip install virtualenvwrapper
    mkvirtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3 notifications-admin
```

Install dependencies and build the frontend assets:
```shell
    workon notifications-admin
    ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

## Rebuilding the frontend assets

If you want the front end assets to re-compile on changes, leave this running
in a separate terminal from the app
```shell
    npm run watch
```

## Create a local environment.sh file containing the following:

```
echo "
export NOTIFY_ENVIRONMENT='development'
export FLASK_APP=application.py
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
export WERKZEUG_DEBUG_PIN=off
"> environment.sh
```

## AWS credentials

Your aws credentials should be stored in a folder located at `~/.aws`. Follow [Amazon's instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-config-files) for storing them correctly


## Running the application

```shell
    workon notifications-admin
    ./scripts/run_app.sh
```

Then visit [localhost:6012](http://localhost:6012)


## Updating application dependencies

`requirements.txt` file is generated from the `requirements-app.txt` in order to pin
versions of all nested dependencies. If `requirements-app.txt` has been changed (or
we want to update the unpinned nested dependencies) `requirements.txt` should be
regenerated with

```
make freeze-requirements
```

`requirements.txt` should be committed alongside `requirements-app.txt` changes.
