        Make a deep copy of `self.param_extensions` to prevent different instances of fields accidentally modifying
        other fields on other forms.

        Fields are instantiated at a class level. This happens at a module level when the file is imported.

        ```
        class MyForm:
            my_field = MyField(param_extensions={'foo': 'bar'})
        ```

        However, through some flask magic, the `__init__` for that field doesn't get called at import time. An instance
        of "UnboundField" is called (which remembers the args and kwargs passed to the constructor). Later on when a
        form is constructed, at that point wtforms calls `unbound_field.bind` which ends up instantiating our form
        class.

        ```
        form_1 = MyForm()
        form_2 = MyForm()
        form_1.my_field != form_2.my_field
        form_1.my_field.param_extensions == form_2.my_field.param_extensions # (!!!!)
        ```

        The problem is that `param_extensions`, a dictionary that we merge in, might already be defined at a class level
        by a Field subclass. It might do this to set up some params specific to that field (such as a phone number field
        setting an input type of "tel").
        A second class of a text input field might set a label containing the header name.

        However, if we just call `merge_jsonlike`, we'll update self.param_extensions, which is actually still linked
        to all the other unbound fields sitting in memory waiting to be bound.

        This means that if you create two forms with the same type field and set param_extensions to different things,
        the second one you instantiate will end up with a merged dict containing both fields' params.

        The solution to this is to make a copy of the class level dictionary first. Then we've got the bound field with
        its own param_extensions, free to manipulate and modify as it needs to.
