<pre class="formatting-example"><code class="lang-md">Apply now at https://www.gov.uk/example

  To convert text into a link, use square brackets around the link text and round brackets around the full URL. Make sure there are no spaces between the brackets or the link will not work. For example:
</p>
<pre class="formatting-example"><code class="lang-md">[Apply now](https://www.gov.uk/example)
</code></pre>
