  <h1 class="heading-large">Delivery status</h1>

  <p>Notify’s real-time dashboard lets you check the status of any message, to see when it was delivered.</p>
  <p>For <a href="{{ url_for("main.security") }}">security</a>, this information is only available for 7 days after a message has been sent. You can download a report, including a list of sent messages, for your own records.</p>
  
  <p>This page describes the types of message status you’ll see when you’re signed in to Notify.</p>
  <p>If you're using the Notify API, read our <a href="{{ url_for('.documentation') }}">documentation</a> for a list of API message statuses.<p>

  <h3 id="spam" class="heading-small">Spam</h3>
  <p>If an email is marked as spam, Notify receives a ‘complaint’ from the email provider. We contact you if we receive a complaint about any of your emails. When this happens you should remove the recipient’s email address from your list.</p>

  <h3 id="open-rates" class="heading-small">Open rates and click-throughs</h3>
  <p>Notify does not track open rates and click-throughs because there are privacy issues. Tracking emails without asking users for their consent risks breaching General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).</p>

  <h3 id="returned-mail" class="heading-small">Undelivered letters and returned mail</h3>

  <p>Every letter we send includes our printer’s address on the back of the envelope. It’s not possible to customise the return address.</p>
  <p>Returned mail is securely destroyed by our printer.</p>
  <p>Each letter has a unique ID. Our printer sends us the ID of every letter they destroy. We contact you if the IDs match any of your letters. This is a partly manual process, so it can take a few weeks.</p>
