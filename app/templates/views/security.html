  <h1 class="heading-large">Security</h1>
  <p class="govuk-body">GOV.UK Notify is built for the needs of government services. It has processes in place to:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>protect user data</li>
    <li>keep systems secure</li>
    <li>manage risks around information</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="heading-medium" id="data">Data</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">On Notify, data is encrypted when:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>it passes through the service</li>
    <li>it’s stored on the service</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">Any recipient data you upload is only held for 7 days.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="/features/email#send-files">send a file by email</a>, the file will be available for the recipient to download for up to 78 weeks (18 months).</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">The Cabinet Office acts as data processor for Notify. Your organisation is the data controller.</p>
  <h3 class="heading-small">Data Protection Act</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">Notify complies with data protection law. To make sure it stays compliant, there are regular legal reviews of the service’s:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

  <p class="govuk-body">If you’re sending a message with sensitive information, you can choose to hide those details on the Notify dashboard once the message has been sent. This means that only the message recipient will be able to see that information.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">You can set different user permissions in Notify. This lets you control who in your team has access to certain parts of the service.</p>

  </ul>
