    <h1 class="heading-large">Features</h1>
    <p>If you work for central government, a local authority or the NHS, you can use GOV.UK Notify to keep your users updated.</p>
    <p>Notify makes it easy to create, customise and send:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>emails</li>
      <li>text messages</li>
      <li>letters</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="{{ url_for('main.register') }}">Create an account</a> for free and try it yourself.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">Reusable message templates</h2>
    <p>To send an email, text or letter with Notify, first create a reusable message template.</p>
    <p>Templates let you send the same thing to lots of people, as often as you need to, without writing a new message each time.</p>
    
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Personalised content</h2>
    <p>Notify makes it easy to send personalised messages from a single template.</p>
    <p>If you want to include the recipient's name or a reference number in your message, you can add a placeholder. Placeholders get filled in each time you send a message. You can do this manually or upload a list of personal details and let Notify do it for you.</p>
    
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Bulk sending</h2>
    <p>To send a batch of messages at once, upload a list of contact details to Notify. You can also schedule the date and time you want them to be sent.</p>
    
    <h2 class="heading-medium">API integration</h2>
    <p>You can integrate the GOV.UK Notify API with your web application or back office system to send messages automatically.</p>
    <p>Read our <a href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/documentation">documentation</a> to find out how to integrate with Notify.</p>
    
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Reporting</h2>
    <p>Notify’s real-time dashboard lets you see the number of messages sent. You can also check the current status of any message, to see when it was delivered.</p>
    <p>Read more about <a href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/features/using-notify#messagestatus">message statuses</a>.</p>
    
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Permissions</h2>
    <p>Control which members of your team can see, create, edit and send messages.</p>
    <p>Notify lets you:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>set different permission levels for each team member</li>
      <li>invite team members who don’t have a government email address</li>
      <li>choose who else can manage team members</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Performance</h2>
    <p>GOV.UK Notify commits to:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>sending 95% of emails and text messages within 10 seconds</li>
      <li>printing and posting letters by 3pm the next working day (if you send them to us before 5pm)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We send messages through several different providers. If one provider fails, Notify switches to another so that your messages are not affected.</p>
    
    <p>Visit GOV.UK Performance to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/performance/govuk-notify">see how Notify is performing</a>.</p>
    
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Security</h2>
    <p>Notify protects and manages data to meet the needs of government services.</p>
    
    <h3 class="heading-small">Hide sensitive information</h3>
    <p>Notify lets you redact personal information from your messages after they've been sent. This means that only the recipient can see that information.</p>
    
    <h3 class="heading-small">Two-factor authentication</h3>
    <p>Notify uses 2FA to keep your account secure. Every time you sign in, we'll send a unique one-time code to your phone and ask you to enter it first.</p>
    <p>Read more about <a href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/features/security">security</a>. 
      
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Support</h2>
    <p>Notify provides 24-hour online support. If you have an emergency outside office hours, we’ll reply within 30  minutes.</p>
