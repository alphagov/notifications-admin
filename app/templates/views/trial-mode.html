  <h1 class="heading-large">Trial mode</h1>

  <p>When you add a new service it will start in trial mode. This lets you try out GOV.UK Notify, with a few restrictions.</p>
  <p>While your service is in trial mode you can only:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
     <li>send 50 text messages and emails per day</li>
      <li>send messages to yourself and other people in your team</li>
     <li>create letter templates, but not send them</li>
   </ul>

  <p>
    To remove these restrictions, you can
    {% if current_service and current_service.trial_mode %}
      <a href="{{ url_for('.request_to_go_live', service_id=current_service.id) }}">send us a request to go live</a>.
    {% else %}
      send us a request to go live.
    {% endif %}
  </p>

  <p>Before you can request to go live, you must:</p>
  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>accept our data sharing and financial agreement</li>
    <li>accept our terms of use</li>
    <li>set up your service so you’re ready to send and receive messages</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When we receive your request we’ll get back to you within one working day.
  </p>
