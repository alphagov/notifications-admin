    This website is run by the GOV.UK Notify team at the Government Digital Service (GDS). It is designed to be used by as many people as possible. You should be able to:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings</li>
    <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>
    <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

  <h2 class="heading-medium" id="how-accessible-this-website-is">How accessible this website is</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the footer with buttons in, on the templates page, sometimes overlaps focused links or checkboxes</li>
    <li>the visual design of the service navigation doesn't work on smaller screens or at high zoom</li>
    <li>some content on the inbox page requires scrolling to see all of it</li>
    <li>the visual design of the letter template page doesn't work on smaller screens or at high zoom</li>
    <li>the page for adding a reply-to email address doesn't update screen reader users on its progress</li>
    <li>links in text messages on the conversation pages don't have enough contrast with their background</li>
    <li>errors from starting a new template aren't focused when they appear</li>
    <li>errors from uploading PDFs aren't focused when they appear</li>
    <li>pages for template folders can be announced in a confusing way by screen readers</li>
    <li>screen reader users may find it hard to expand or collapse groups of checkboxes</li>
    <li>the Notify status page has several accessibility issues</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We also know that the emails Notify sends are not fully accessible. The NVDA screen reader announces extra spaces in emails when you view them in Microsoft Outlook.

    The website has been tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standard.

  <p class="govuk-body">

  <h2 class="heading-medium" id="non-accessible-content">Non-accessible content</h2>

  <h3 class="heading-small" id="non-compliance">Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The following content on the Notify website is not compliant with the WCAG version 2.2 AA standard:
  </p>

  <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
    <li>
      The footer containing the 'New template' and 'New Folder' buttons on the templates page sometimes obscures links or checkboxes in the page when they are tabbed to. This means keyboard-only users can lose sight of what is currently in focus and breaks <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-minimum.html">success criterion 2.4.11: focus obscured (minimum)</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The navigation showing your current organisation and service has visual problems on smaller screens. This makes it hard to use on mobile devices or at levels of zoom at 400% on a 1280 pixel screen and breaks <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html">success criterion 1.4.10: Reflow</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Content on the inbox page needs horizontal scrolling on smaller screens. This makes it harder to access on mobile devices or at levels of zoom at 400% on a 1280 pixel screen and breaks <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html">success criterion 1.4.10: Reflow</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The design of the letter template page doesn't work on smaller screens. This makes it harder to access on mobile devices or at levels of zoom at 400% on a 1280 pixel screen and breaks <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html">success criterion 1.4.10: Reflow</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The page for adding a reply-to email address gives progress updates that are only communicated visually. This is confusing for screen reader users and breaks <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages.html">success criterion 4.1.3: Status messages</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Links in the text messages shown on the conversation page don't have enough contrast with their background. This makes them harder to read for low vision users and breaks <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html">success criterion 1.4.3: Contrast (minimum)</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="heading-small" id="problems-with-using-the-interface">Problems with using the interface</h3>

  <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
    <li>
      Page headings on pages for folders can be confusing when using a screen reader. We are investigating this issue.
    </li>
    <li>
      Expanding and collapsing groups of checkboxes using a screen reader can be confusing.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you don't choose a template type when starting a new template, the banner that tells you that isn't focused. This is confusing for keyboard-only users and isn't consistent with how this is done elsewhere on Notify.
    </li>
    <li>
      The banner that tells you about errors in PDFs you upload isn't focused when it appears. This is confusing for keyboard-only users and isn't consistent with how this is done elsewhere on Notify.

    How we tested this service
  </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We revised what makes up the common tasks GOV.UK Notify users need to complete and tested them against WCAG 2.2 in September 2024. We are now in the process of fixing all issues identified by this testing. All tests were carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The parts of the website used to add <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="{{ url_for('main.guidance_email_branding') }}">email branding</a> or <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="{{ url_for('main.guidance_letter_branding') }}">letter branding</a> were tested on 9 October 2023. The button for copying text in the page to your clipboard and the component for choosing the day and time to send notifications were also tested as part of this.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The parts of the website used to send text messages, emails and letters were last tested in February 2021. The emails we send out, the web pages users see when they are sent a file by Notify and a sample letter PDF were last tested on 11 March 2019. All tests were carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    We originally decided which pages to test based on the most common tasks that GOV.UK Notify users need to complete. We also tested a sample of pages with common user interface components. Since then, we test any new features or substantial changes to the service.
