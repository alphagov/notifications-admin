  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Low vision users cannot access the table we use to show CSV data when viewed at high zoom. This fails <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#reflow">WCAG 1.4.10 success criteria (Reflow)</a>. We plan to fix this by the end of 2020.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Keyboard-only and voice activation users cannot focus on the table we use to show CSV data. This fails <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard">WCAG 2.1.1 success criteria (Keyboard)</a>. We plan to fix this by November 2020.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">
    PDFs and other documents
  </h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Some pages have links to PDF documents, and these PDF documents are not fully accessible. This is not a fail under any WCAG 2.1 success criterion. We provide the information contained in these PDFs in an accessible HTML format.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Some of our PDFs are essential to providing our services. For example, we have a PDF that shows the layout of our letter specification. We provide a written description of this information on an HTML page as an accessible alternative.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The accessibility regulations do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services. For example, we do not plan to fix [example of non-essential document].
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">
