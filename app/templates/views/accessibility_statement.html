  </p>

  <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
    <li>
      The (before <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>) code for the ‘upload a file’ button may cause issues for assistive technology users. This fails <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships">success criterion 1.3.1: info and relationships</a>. We plan to fix this by the end of October 2021.
    </li>

  <h3 class="heading-small">Problems with using the interface</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We’ve identified the following problems with the user interface:
  </p>

  <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">

      The JAWS screen reader announces template folder page headings as multiple sentences. We hope to be able to fix this by the end of 2021.
    </li>
    <li>
      Our validation errors cause problems for screen readers. This means it can be hard to know when an error has occurred or what to do next. We hope to be able to fix this by the end of 2021.
    </li>
    <li>
      The way we label the different regions of our pages is confusing for screen reader users. We plan to fix this by the end of October 2021.
    </li>
    <li>
      Choosing the date and time you want to send a message using a screen reader can be confusing. We hope to be able to fix this by the end of 2021.

    <li>
      Expanding and collapsing groups of checkboxes using a screen reader can be confusing. We hope to be able to fix this by the end of 2021.
