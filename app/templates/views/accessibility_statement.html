  <h2 class="heading-medium" id="compliance-status">Compliance status</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We have tested the Notify website against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standard.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard, due to a non-compliance listed below.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium" id="non-accessible-content">Non-accessible content</h2>

  <h3 class="heading-small" id="non-compliance">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The following content on the Notify website is not compliant with the WCAG version 2.2 AA standard:
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The notice telling users that they have successfully added a reply-to address is not being announced correctly by screen readers
    which fails <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages.html">success criterion 4.1.3: Status messages</a>.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small" id="emails">
    Emails
  </h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The following content in emails sent by Notify is not compliant with the WCAG version 2.2 AA standard:
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Emails zoomed past 220% on the Microsoft Outlook application overflow the screen and so need scrolling to read which fails WCAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html">success criterion 1.4.10: Reflow</a>.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The NVDA screen reader also announces extra spaces in emails when viewed in Microsoft Outlook. This does not fail WCAG but is known to cause confusion for users of NVDA.
  </p>

  <h3 class="heading-small" id="status-page">
    Status page
  </h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The following content on the <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="https://status.notifications.service.gov.uk/">Notify status page</a> is not compliant with the WCAG version 2.2 AA standard:

  <h2 class="heading-medium" id="how-we-tested-this-service">
    How we tested this service
  </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We revised the list of common tasks that GOV.UK Notify users need to complete and tested them against WCAG 2.2 in September 2024. We fixed the issues identified in September and tested them again in February 2025. We are now working on any new issues identified in the latest round of testing.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The parts of the website used to add <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="{{ url_for('main.guidance_email_branding') }}">email branding</a> or <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="{{ url_for('main.guidance_letter_branding') }}">letter branding</a> were first tested in October 2023. Fixes to the button for copying text in the page to your clipboard and a new design of the component for choosing the day and time to send notifications were also tested as part of this.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The parts of the website used to send text messages, emails and letters were first tested in July 2020 and the resulting fixes tested in January 2021. The emails we send out, the web pages users see when they are sent a file by Notify and a sample letter PDF were last tested on 4 March 2019.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    All tests were carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    We originally decided which pages to test based on the most common tasks that GOV.UK Notify users need to complete. We also tested a sample of pages with common user interface components.
    Since then, we test any new features or substantial changes to the service. We also aim to review the common tasks and retest them every 2 years.
