    <li>
      Our validation errors cause problems for screen readers. This means it can be hard to know when an error has occurred or what to do next. We have started working on this issue. We are still exploring how much work it will take to fix it.
    </li>
    <li>
      The JAWS screen reader announces template folder page headings as multiple sentences. We are investigating this issue and plan to fix it in September 2023.
    </li>
    <li>
      Choosing the date and time you want to send a message using a screen reader can be confusing. We have begun work on this issue and plan to fix it in July 2023.

    How we tested this service
  </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The parts of the website used to send text messages, emails and letters were last tested in February 2021. The emails we send out, the web pages users see when they are sent a file by Notify and a sample letter PDF were last tested on 11 March 2019. Both tests were carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We decided which pages to test based on the most common tasks that GOV.UK Notify users need to complete. We also tested a sample of pages with common user interface components.
