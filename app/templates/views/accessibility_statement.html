  <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
    <li>
      Our validation errors cause problems for screen readers. This means it can be hard to know when an error has occurred or what to do next. We have started updating our validation errors and plan to complete this work by the end of January 2023.
    </li>
    <li>
      The JAWS screen reader announces template folder page headings as multiple sentences. We are investigating this issue and plan to fix it in February 2023.
    </li>
    <li>
      Expanding and collapsing groups of checkboxes using a screen reader can be confusing. We plan to fix this by January 2023.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are several problems with our branding preview iframes. They do not have a title attribute and include content that may be confusing for screen reader users. They also have a fixed width, which means they appear cropped on devices with small screens. We plan to fix these problems by [DATE].
    </li>
    <li>
      If you select an existing branding from the list of options, 2 consecutive pages will have the same title and h1. This is especially confusing for screen reader users. We plan to fix this by [DATE].
    </li>
    <li>
      The ‘skip’ link forces screen readers to jump to the main content area on every branding page. This may be confusing for screen reader users. We plan to fix this by [DATE].
    </li>
    <li>
      If you use the ‘back’ link to return to the first page of the branding journey, any options you’ve chosen will be lost. We plan to fix this by [DATE].
    </li>
    <li>
      When you select ‘Get ready to send’, the next page loads with the focus on the text input field. This may be confusing for screen reader users. We plan to fix this by [DATE].
    </li>
    <li>
      When you upload contact details and then tab through the page, the focus jumps to the table. This may be confusing for screen reader users. We plan to fix this by [DATE].
    </li>
    <li>
      Screen readers do not announce the column headings for a table of contact details. We plan to fix this by [DATE].

    How we tested this service
  </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The parts of the website used to add <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="{{ url_for('main.guidance_email_branding') }}">email branding</a> or <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="{{ url_for('main.guidance_letter_branding') }}">letter branding</a> were tested on 9 October 2023. The button for copying text in the page to your clipboard and the component for choosing the day and time to send notifications were also tested as part of this.
    The parts of the website used to send text messages, emails and letters were last tested in February 2021. The emails we send out, the web pages users see when they are sent a file by Notify and a sample letter PDF were last tested on 11 March 2019. All tests were carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We originally decided which pages to test based on the most common tasks that GOV.UK Notify users need to complete. We also tested a sample of pages with common user interface components. Since then, we test any new features or substantial changes to the service.
