    How we tested this service
  </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We revised what makes up the common tasks GOV.UK Notify users need to complete and tested them against WCAG 2.2 in September 2024. We are now in the process of fixing all issues identified by this testing. All tests were carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The parts of the website used to add <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="{{ url_for('main.guidance_email_branding') }}">email branding</a> or <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="{{ url_for('main.guidance_letter_branding') }}">letter branding</a> were tested on 9 October 2023. The button for copying text in the page to your clipboard and the component for choosing the day and time to send notifications were also tested as part of this.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The parts of the website used to send text messages, emails and letters were last tested in February 2021. The emails we send out, the web pages users see when they are sent a file by Notify and a sample letter PDF were last tested on 11 March 2019. All tests were carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    We originally decided which pages to test based on the most common tasks that GOV.UK Notify users need to complete. We also tested a sample of pages with common user interface components. Since then, we test any new features or substantial changes to the service.
