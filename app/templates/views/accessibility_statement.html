  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>validation errors may be confusing for screen reader users</li>
    <li>the ‘copy to clipboard’ button does not work with some screen readers</li>

    How we tested this service
  </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The parts of the website used to send text messages, emails and letters were last tested in February 2021. The emails we send out, the web pages users see when they are sent a file by Notify and a sample letter PDF were last tested on 11 March 2019. Both tests were carried out by DAC.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We decided which pages to test based on the most common tasks that GOV.UK Notify users need to complete. We also tested a sample of pages with common user interface components.
