  <h1 class="heading-large">Delivery times</h1>

  <p class="govuk-body">The {{ service_link(current_service, 'main.service_dashboard', 'dashboard') }} lets you check the status of a message, to see when it was delivered.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">To <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="{{ url_for("main.guidance_security") }}">keep recipient data safe</a>, this information is only available for 7 days after a message has been sent. You can download a report, including a list of sent messages, for your own records.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Find out <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="{{ url_for('main.guidance_message_status') }}">what each message status means</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="emails" class="heading-medium">Emails</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">Notify commits to sending 95% of emails within 10 seconds.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Once an email has been sent, our email provider will try to deliver it to the recipient for up to 72 hours.</p>

  <h3 id="open-rates" class="heading-small">Open rates and click-throughs</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">Notify cannot tell you if your users open an email or click on the links in an email. We do not track open rates and click-throughs because there are privacy issues. Tracking emails without asking permission from users could breach General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).</p>

  <h2 id="text-messages"  class="heading-medium">Text messages</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">Notify commits to sending 95% of text messages within 10 seconds.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Once a message has been sent, our text message provider will try to deliver it to the recipient for up to 72 hours.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">We send text messages through different providers. If one provider fails, Notify switches to another so that your text messages are not affected.</p>

  <h2 id="letters" class="heading-medium">Letters</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">Letters are printed at 5:30pm and dispatched the next working day (Monday to Friday).</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">First class letters are delivered one day after they’re dispatched. Second class letters are delivered 2 days after they’re dispatched. Royal Mail delivers from Monday to Saturday, excluding bank holidays.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Letters to Europe are delivered 3 to 5 days after they’re dispatched. Letters sent anywhere else in the world take 5 to 7 days to arrive.</p>

  <h3 id="returned-mail" class="heading-small">Returned letters</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">Every letter we send includes our print provider’s address on the back of the envelope. You cannot customise the return address.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Undelivered letters are returned to our print provider and destroyed.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">A returned letters report is available on the dashboard. Use this report to help identify the letters returned.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you’re using the Notify API, you can automate identifying the returned letters. Follow the instructions in our <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state"
    href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/using-notify/api-documentation">API documentation</a>.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">You’ll need a developer on your team to set this up for you.</p>
