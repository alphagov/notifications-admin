    <h1 class="heading-large">Using Notify</h1>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">Writing and sending text messages, emails and letters</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/sending-emails-and-text-messages">Check the Service Manual</a> for guidance on how to:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>plan and write text messages and emails</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/how-to-email-your-users">send emails</a> in a way that protects users from spam and phishing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="trial-mode" class="heading-medium">Trial mode</h2>
    <p>When you sign up to GOV.UK Notify, you’ll start in trial mode. In trial mode, you can send up to 50 text messages and emails a day. You can only send them to yourself and other people in your team.</p>
    <p>You can’t send letters in trial mode.</p>
    <p>When you request to go live on Notify, we’ll remove these restrictions.</p>

    <h2 id="messagedeliveryandfailure" class="heading-medium">Sending messages</h2>
    <p>When you send a message, it moves through different states in Notify.</p>
    <img
        src="/static/images/message-sending-flow.svg"
        alt="A picture of the sending flow of messages in Notify, showing the three states of Sending, Delivered, And Failed. Also shows the next
             steps when messages fail, deleting data and trying a new channel for permanent failures, and trying again or trying a new channel for
             temporary failures"

    <h3 class="heading-small">Sending</h3>
    <p>This means that we’ve accepted the message and are sending it to our delivery providers.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-small">Delivered</h3>
    <p>You’ll see this when Notify has successfully delivered a message to user’s email inbox or phone.</p>
    <p>Notify won’t tell you if a user has opened or read a message.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-small">Sent internationally</h3>
    <p>You’ll see this when Notify sends a text message to an international number, but mobile networks in that country don’t provide delivery receipts.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-small">Phone number or email address does not exist</h3>
    <p>You’ll see this when Notify couldn’t deliver a message because the email address or phone number was wrong.</p>
    <p>You should remove these email addresses or phone numbers from your database.</p>
    <p>You’ll still be charged for text messages to numbers that don’t exist.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-small">Inbox/phone not accepting messages right now</h3>
    <p>You’ll see this if Notify can’t deliver an email or text message after trying for 72 hours.</p>
    <p>This might happen for a number of reasons. For example, the user’s inbox might be full, or their phone might be turned off.</p>
    <p>You can try sending the message again if you want.</p>
    <p>You’ll still be charged for text messages to phones that aren’t accepting messages.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-small">Technical failure</h3>
    <p>A technical failure means there’s a problem between Notify and our delivery providers. </p>
    <p>You’ll have to try sending your messages again. </p>
    <p>You won’t be charged for text messages that are affected by a technical failure.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">Receiving messages</h2>
    <h3 class="heading-small">Email replies</h3>
    <p>You can choose an email address you want replies to go to.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-small">Text messages</h3>
    <p>You can contact us if you want to be able to receive text messages. </p>
    <p>When you’ve done this, users will be able to reply to text messages you send them. They’ll also be able to start an interaction by sending you a text message.</p>
    <p>You’ll be able to see and reply to text messages you receive. You can also create automated processes to manage replies.</p>
    <p>You’ll still need to have a manual process in place for any messages that can’t be dealt with automatically.</p>
